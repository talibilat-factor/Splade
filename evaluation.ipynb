    "## Retrieval Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why BM25 was initially higher\n",
    "1. **Lexical alignment**: BM25 directly leverages exact token overlap between short QA context snippets and corpus lines; dense and SPLADE variants were penalized by using fuzzy matching on very short spans.\n",
    "2. **Incorrect SPLADE scoring**: Earlier implementation used L2 distance with sign inversion. SPLADE should use inner product on sparsified expansion weights; switching to `IndexFlatIP` fixes this.\n",
    "3. **Normalization differences**: SentenceTransformer embeddings were normalized (cosine), SPLADE vectors were not. L2 ranking distorted relative magnitudes; inner product preserves term-weight contributions.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation matching threshold**: A uniform fuzzy threshold (70) favors exact lexical retrievers; dense retrievers surface semantically similar but lexically different chunks that may score below the token-set threshold.\n",
    "5. **Chunk granularity**: The corpus is line-based; lexical methods benefit from narrower, specific matches. Dense methods typically perform better on paragraph‑level representations; here they had fewer semantic signals per chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixes applied\n",
    "- Changed SPLADE index to `IndexFlatIP` and used direct inner product scores.\n",
    "- Rebuilt SPLADE retrieval loop to remove inverted L2 distance logic.\n",
    "- Added unified evaluation cell computing Hit@1/3/5 + MRR across all methods for consistent comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended next adjustments\n",
    "- Re-evaluate fuzzy matching using both `context_chunk` and `answer_snippet`; consider lowering threshold (e.g., 60) for dense methods or using semantic similarity rather than fuzzy lexical ratio.\n",
    "- Aggregate adjacent lines into larger chunks (50–120 tokens) to improve semantic model signal.\n",
    "- Add query / chunk text normalization (lowercase, strip punctuation) before fuzzy matching for consistency.\n",
    "- For SPLADE, optionally apply vocabulary pruning or top-k term retention to reduce noise and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting results\n",
    "- If BM25 still leads: Corpus likely dominated by exact contractual phrasing; leverage hybrid (BM25 + dense score) reranking.\n",
    "- If SPLADE improves after changes: Lexical expansion captured synonyms / morphological variants missed by raw BM25.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Run all modified cells, inspect the updated comparison and consider implementing a reranker combining BM25 top-50 followed by dense or SPLADE scoring to raise semantic recall without losing precision."
